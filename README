# 2Safe

...is a prototype of a personal safety navigator, created to help people find their way through the
urban environment.It's a 2-day hackathon project built from scratch using the following tech stack:
*Vite and Flask build
*TypeScript, React and AntDesign for frontend
\*Python is used for API, anlysis, algoritmics and geodata tiling
Our project also enjoys wide use of 2GIS.API tools, first and foremost for spatial tasks such as geocoding.
2Safe's main idea is to create a custom weighted graph from open-source urban big data frames and implement costmap
navigation algoritms to create the safest route posssible to bring you home. It uses metrics such as:
-street illumination
-CCTV coverage
-traffic danger
etc.etc.

It's intended audience are children and women, for whom navigatiing a city, escpecially after dark, has always been a challenge,
and, by extension, family members, friends and guardians.
